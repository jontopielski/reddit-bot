# RedditBot
Python script that parses through specified subreddits, obtaining all top comments (replies) from submissions ending in a '?'

# End Goal
To parse all posts in a given subreddit and store all submissions that are questions (ending with a '?') in a list,
along with their top comments in another list (usually the answer to those questions) and observe the data.

# Side Goal
Parse through all the questions and store the questions based on frequency of common words, ignoring common words such as
the, and, or, etc. Show how many questions contain certain words and summarize the answer to the most frequent problems.
